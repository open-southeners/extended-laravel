# Middleware

### ForceHttpsScheme

This middleware will enforce the same scheme to any URL generated by the framework so in any case the current requested URL contains HTTPS won't mix the non-secured HTTP for things like images and other assets embedded using Laravel functions like `asset` , `route` or `url`.

Add this middleware on your Laravel app:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Laravel 11+" %}
Add the following to your `bootstrap/app.php`

<pre class="language-php"><code class="lang-php"><strong>->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
</strong>    $middleware->append([
        \App\Http\Middleware\ForceHttpsScheme::class,
    ]);
})
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Laravel 10" %}
Add the following to your `app/Http/Kernel.php`

```php
/**
 * The application's global HTTP middleware stack.
 *
 * These middleware are run during every request to your application.
 *
 * @var array<int, class-string|string>
 */
protected $middleware = [
    \App\Http\Middleware\ForceHttpsScheme::class,
    // The rest of global middleware...
];
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
